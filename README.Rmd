First, download the data, unzip it and saves it in data frames (rows 5-17) then it combines the train and test data (18-20)

As a second step, we extract the headers from features.txt, taking only those which contain mean or std (23-25) and takes only that columns from the variable xdata

The third step (re)names the activities (31-33) and the fourth step labels the data set (37-39)

The last step applies the function colMeans (from package plyr) to all combinations of subject and activity, storing it in a txt file (43,45)
