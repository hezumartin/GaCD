# Variables

train: table at "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
test: table at "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
tt: train and test variables combined



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
